# Apache Spark Optimization & Performance Tuning
> A practical project demonstrating performance tuning techniques in Apache Spark using PySpark. This project is based on a full walkthrough of Spark internals and optimization strategies from a deep-dive.
---
## üìå Project Overview
This repository showcases how to identify performance bottlenecks and apply optimization techniques in Apache Spark. It uses real-world data and benchmarks to compare performance with and without optimizations using techniques like:
- Broadcast joins
- Partition pruning
- Catalyst physical plans
- Caching
- Dynamic resource allocation

The goal is to build awareness around Spark's execution model and improve job efficiency with hands-on examples.
---
## üîç Key Features
- Compare **Broadcast Hash Join vs Sort Merge Join**
- Monitor **storage-level caching impacts**
- Analyze **Spark UI DAG & physical plan** with caching enabled/disabled
- Apply **DataFrame-level transformations and triggers**
- Use **Spark SQL hints** for join strategies
- Track performance using Spark UI & memory storage
---
## üìä Technologies Used
- Apache Spark (PySpark)
- Google Colab (optional)
- Python
- Parquet/JSON files for test data

## üß™ Use Cases Covered
| Optimization Technique        | Scenario Example                                      |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Broadcast Join               | Small country lookup table vs large transactions     |
| Partition Pruning            | Filtering by partition column (e.g., date, user_id)  |
| Storage Level Caching        | `df.cache()` vs uncached DataFrame                   |
| SQL Hints                    | `/*+ BROADCAST(table) */` for faster joins           |
| Physical Plan Analysis       | `explain()` output walkthrough                       |
